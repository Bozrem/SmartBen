Custom Smart Alarm Clock Built for Raspberry Pi

I was inspired by seeing a very overpriced alarm clock to ask myself the question "how hard could it be?"\
Refer to documentation to get a more in-depth look at the systems functionality, as this will just overview the features

## Features
### Alarms
Has alarms configurable with custom media and integration with the light feature
### Rise Light
Seen in some overpriced alarm clocks, a small light that slowly turns on before an alarm to simulate the suns rising
### Bluetooth Speaker
Pressing the Bluetooth button on the top will allow the user to connect to the speaker and use it to play media and send commands
### Phone App
The clock will have a companion app used to send various commands to the clock and manage alarms, connecting over Bluetooth
### Smart Display
The Clock will feature a smart display at the front to give various information including time, current media, upcoming alarms, weather, and more
